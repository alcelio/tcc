We can identify an important issue as the educational process is analyzed: the process of
learning evaluation. Because of great importance of the topic in the teaching-learning
process, it is subject to many studies and promotes intensive discussions among educational
experts and professionals. Despites all the debates, there is still not a consensus of the best
way and tool for evaluation. Outside the root of discussions in the current educational
scenario the process of evaluation is fundamental. Experts say the timely correction of
exercises and exams of students is essential for their studies. However, exhaustive school
routines in classes with large number of students may compromise the successful completion
of this task by teachers. This work aims to create a software to help the process of learning
evaluation. The proposal takes into account the development of a platform for creation,
application and correction of several types of evaluations automatically also considering the
creation of information to assist in managing this process. The software building is going to
combine concepts of recommender systems and multi-agent systems to generate
customization and proactive mechanisms for user assistance.
